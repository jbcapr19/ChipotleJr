"#ChipotleJr Program that allows a robot to assemble 25 burritos. Uses a random generator for each burrito option and builds a list of 25 burrito customizations: Developed using OOP concepts using Java class for Burritto with static methods for getters and setters for the class objects, methods also defined to printcontents of a burritto and compute the pricing information. Care was taken to keep the processing out of main function and define methods to buildBurritto() and printBurritto() to keep program modular and clean."
